# AbsoluteJava
The Solutions for Absolute Java Book (COMP 248), Concordia University

#Introduction:
The book Absolute Java is a book that works on programming and starts from zero. It is designed for the non-experienced programmers.

#What does this repository has:
It has the solution of each problem in each chapter. Please note some problems where skipped either because they are too easy or because they just do not worth it.
It has the solution of the programming projects of each chapter.
I will be using the naming convention of: Problem(CHAPTER)_(NUMBER) and it is saved in packages by each chapter Problem_CHAPTER.

Cheers
