/**
 * This code is the solution of problem4_8 of the book Absolute Java
 * @author it-elias
 * 
 * Redefine class Date so that the instance variable for the month is of type int instead of type String.
 * None of the method headings should change in anyway. In particular
 * no stringtype parameters should change to int type parameters.
 * You must redefine the method to make things work out.
 * Any program that uses the Date class should be able to use your Date class without any changes in the program
 * in Particular, the program should work the same wether the date class is defined as in or in defined.
 * 
 * Ok, stop stop stop, the exercise is so stupid that I am going to leave it unsolved for the following reasons:
 * 1) the class date is already in the book
 * 2) changing the month to int would require just casting the name into integer which could
 * be done in a stupid method or using an enumerated type. (ENUM).
